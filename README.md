# Auto_CV_Workflow
Via email, the workflow extracts key candidate details using AI. It parses attached CVs (PDF/Word), identifies fields such as name, role, contact information, and skills, then logs the data into Google Sheets. This reduces manual entry, increases accuracy, and scales efficiently for high-volume recruitment.
