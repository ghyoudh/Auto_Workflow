# Workflow_1 --> Customer_Feedback 
A workflow that analyzes customer feedback submitted through a form using an AI sentiment model. The system classifies each entry as positive, neutral, or negative and logs the results into Google Sheets. A secondary automation monitors new rows and sends email notifications based on sentiment, enabling faster response to critical customer concerns.

# workflow_2 --> Auto_CV
Via email, the workflow extracts key candidate details using AI. It parses attached CVs (PDF/Word), identifies fields such as name, role, contact information, and skills, then logs the data into Google Sheets. This reduces manual entry, increases accuracy, and scales efficiently for high-volume recruitment.
